HP48
====

This is Reverse Polish LISP software created on and for my HP48GX,
in the Stone Age before the Interwebs.

*GEB* are programs I created to understand the venerable book,
[GÃ¶del Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach)

*MIKE* is an attempt at this repetitive grammar of my friend Mike Robert Avery.

*TRIP* is a handy auto trip calculator I made and used for years.

Sadly, these programs were made before I understood the importance of documentation. :\
